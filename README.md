This repository includes the source files (library) and documentation of the HPC model, the sensitive analysis report (Rmarkdown), and a user interface for running and visualising simulations (Shiny app). 

The entire repository is the directory of an R Project that runs in RStudio. Download it to consult and use all files locally. 

Alternatively, explore the following online features:

- Explore single simulation runs using the Shiny App hosted in ShinyApps.io: https://andros-spica.shinyapps.io/HPCShinyApp/

- Consult the HTML version of the sensitivity analysis report: https://andros-spica.github.io/hpcModel

- See our a presentation overviewing the model and its results, hosted in another repository: https://github.com/Andros-Spica/ENE-Angourakis-et-al-2019

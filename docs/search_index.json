The model consists of an ecological positive feedback system (mutualism), which can be reinforced by positive evolutionary feedback (coevolution). Figure 0.1: Human-plant coevolution dynamics The model is the result of wiring together relatively simple simulation models of population ecology and evolution, through a computational implementation in R. "],["ecological-relationships-and-population-dynamics.html", "Ecological relationships and population dynamics", " Ecological relationships and population dynamics The model can be expressed by a relatively simple system of two discrete-time difference equations (Eq. 1 and 2), based on the Verhulst-Pearl Logistic equation (chapter 9, Kingsland 1982; Pianka 1974). The change of both populations (\\(\\Delta H[t]\\), \\(\\Delta P[t]\\); see Table 3) depends on an intrinsic growth rate (\\(r_{H}, r_{P}\\)), the population at a given time (\\(H[t]\\), \\(P[t]\\)) and the respective carrying capacity of the environment for each population (\\(K_{H}[t]\\), \\(K_{P}[t]\\)), which may vary over time. \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{Eq. 1} H[t+1]=H[t]+r_{H}H[t]-r_{H}\\frac{H[t]^{2}}{K_{H}[t]} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{Eq. 2} P[t+1]=P[t]+r_{P}P[t]-r_{P}\\frac{P[t]^{2}}{K_{P}[t]} \\end{equation}\\] Human and plant populations engage in a mutualistic relationship, where one species is to some extent sustained by the other (Eq. 3 and 4). The mutualistic relationship is defined in the model as an increment of the carrying capacity of population B caused by population A (\\(U_{AB}[t]\\)). This increment, expressed as the utility of A to B at a given time is the product of the utility per capita of A to B (\\(\\bar{U}_{AB}\\)) and the population A at a given time (Eq. 5 and 6). We consider that both populations are sustained also by an independent term, representing the baseline carrying capacity of the environment or the utility gain from other resources, which is time-dependent (\\(U_{bH}[t]\\), \\(U_{bP}[t]\\)). While we assume that the growth of the human population has no predefined ceiling, the expansion of the plant population is considered limited as the area over which plants can grow contiguously (\\(MaxArea\\)), and represented as a compendium of both space and the maximum energy available in a discrete location (Eq. 4). \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{Eq. 3} K_{H}[t]=U_{PH}[t]+U_{bH}[t] \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{Eq. 4} K_{P}[t]=\\min(U_{HP}[t]+U_{bP}[t],\\, MaxArea) \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{Eq. 5} U_{HP}[t]=H[t]\\cdot \\bar{U}_{HP} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{Eq. 6} U_{PH}[t]=P[t]\\cdot \\bar{U}_{PH} \\end{equation}\\] Considering that mutualistic relationships involve a positive feedback loop, the population growth at time t improves the conditions for both humans and plants at time \\(t + 1\\), sustaining their growth even further. Assumptions on ecological relationships and population dynamics Domains Assumptions On interacting populations A population of humans interacts with a population of plants On population growth Population growth is a self-catalyzing process, where the population density in the present will contribute to its own increase in the future, depending on an intrinsic growth rate (r)  Population growth is a self-limiting process, where the population density in the present will constraint its own increase in the future, depending on respective carrying capacity of the environment (K)  The logistic growth model is acceptable as an approximation to the dynamics of populations, both human and plant, under constant conditions  The carrying capacity of the environment for a population depends on constant factors and on a time-varying factor (K[t]) On positive ecological relationships Positive ecological relationships exist, where an individual of one population increases by an amount the carrying capacity of the environment for another population  Coupled positive ecological relationships (i.e., mutualism) exist, where two populations increase the carrying capacities for each other  There is variation in positive ecological relationships, so individuals of one population vary in terms of how much they increase the carrying capacity for the other population On human-plant mutualism A given plant species yield a positive utility for humans, e.g., as a source of food and raw materials  Humans return a positive utility for this plant species, e.g., by improving soil conditions  The utility given by one population adds value to the carrying capacity for the other, and vice versa  The carrying capacity for humans rely also in other resources, which are independent of the plant species (i.e., the baseline carrying capacity for humans)  The carrying capacity for plants rely also in other conditions, which are independent of humans (i.e., the baseline carrying capacity for plants)  The carrying capacity for plants is eventually constrained by the space available for it to grow contiguously as a population (i.e., maximum area) "],["population-diversity.html", "Population diversity", " Population diversity The HPC model contemplates a vector (pop) of length n, containing the population fractions of each type. The number of types are population-specific and are given as two parameters (\\(n_{H}\\), \\(n_{P}\\)). These types include all possible variations within a population so that this vector amounts to the unity (\\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{pop_{A_{i}}}=1\\)). To account for multiple types, we replace Eq. 5 and 6 with Eq. 7 and 8, where the utility of population A to B at any given time (\\(U_{AB}[t]\\)) is calculated by summing up the utility per capita of each type (\\(\\bar{U}_{A_{i}B}\\)) proportionally to the share of population of the respective type (\\(pop_{A_{i}}[t]\\)), and multiplying the result by the population at a given time. The baseline carrying capacity (\\(U_{bA_{i}}[t]\\)) is calculated in a similar manner, though using the utility that each type is able to gain from other resources (\\(U_{bA_{i}}\\)) (Eq. 9 and 10). \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{Eq. 7} U_{HP}[t]=H[t]\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{H}}{pop_{H_{i}}[t]\\cdot \\bar{U}_{H_{i}P}} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{Eq. 8} U_{PH}[t]=P[t]\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{P}}{pop_{P_{i}}[t]\\cdot \\bar{U}_{P_{i}H}} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{Eq. 9} U_{bH}[t]=\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{H}}{pop_{H_{i}}[t]\\cdot U_{bH_{i}}} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{Eq. 10} U_{bP}[t]=\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{P}}{pop_{P_{i}}[t]\\cdot U_{bP_{i}}} \\end{equation}\\] Types relate to population-specific values of utility per capita (\\(\\bar{U}_{A_{i}B}\\)) and baseline carrying capacity (\\(U_{bA_{i}}\\)). These values are defined by linear interpolation between pairs of parameters representing the values corresponding to types \\(1\\) and \\(n\\) (e.g., if \\(n_P=10\\), \\(\\bar{U}_{P_{1}H}=1\\) and \\(\\bar{U}_{P_{n}H}=10\\), then \\(\\bar{U}_{P_{5}H}=5\\)). The shares of population within types follow a one-tail distribution rather than a normal distribution, which would be more adequate but less straightforward to use in a theoretical model. Under this circumstance, the distribution of population within types will always be biased towards the intermediate types. "],["coevolutionary-dynamics.html", "Coevolutionary dynamics", " Coevolutionary dynamics Undirected variation, which causes part of the population to randomly change to other types, represents the effect of mutation in genetic transmission or of innovation, error, and other mechanisms in cultural transmission. The balance of the subpopulation A of type \\(i\\) depends on the level of undirected variation (\\(v_{A}\\)) and on the degree and sign of the difference between the current subpopulation (\\(pop_{A_{i}}[t]\\)) and the averaged subpopulation (\\(1/n_{A}\\)), which refers to the completely uniform distribution among types (Eq. 11 and 12). \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{Eq. 11} pop_{H}[t]&#39;=pop_{H}[t]+v_{H}\\left(\\tfrac{1}{n_{H}}-pop_{H}[t]\\right) \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{Eq. 12} pop_{P}[t]&#39;=pop_{P}[t]+v_{P}\\left(\\tfrac{1}{n_{P}}-pop_{P}[t]\\right) \\end{equation}\\] By considering inertia, we are assuming that the more frequent a type is, the more likely that it is transmitted. Selection is implemented by assigning a fitness score to each type (\\(fitness_{A_{i}}[t]\\)), which in turn biases its transmission. Equations 13 and 14 summarizes the combined effect that inertia and selection have on the proportion of population A belonging to type \\(i\\) (\\(pop_{A_{i}}[t]\\)) [for a formal similarity of the discrete replicator dynamic and Bayesian inference see Harper2009]. \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{Eq. 13} pop_{H_{i}}[t+1]=\\frac{fitness_{H_{i}}[t]\\cdot pop_{H_{i}}[t]}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{H}}fitness_{H_{j}}[t]\\cdot pop_{H_{j}}[t]} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{Eq. 14} pop_{P_{i}}[t+1]=\\frac{fitness_{P_{i}}[t]\\cdot pop_{P_{i}}[t]}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{P}}fitness_{P_{j}}[t]\\cdot pop_{P_{j}}[t]} \\end{equation}\\] This mechanism defines how a trait evolves in a single population. However, coevolution can also be represented when the selective pressure on this population is modified by the changing traits of another population. In order to link the two populations, fitness scores of population A are derived from the weight of the contribution or utility of population B (\\(U_{BA}[t]\\)) in relation to the base carrying capacity of A (\\(K_{A}[t]\\)) (Eq. 10). \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{Eq. 15} fitness_{H_{i}}[t]=\\frac{(n_{H}-i)\\,U_{bH}[t]+i\\,U_{PH}[t]}{U_{bH}[t]+U_{PH}[t]} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{Eq. 16} fitness_{P_{i}}[t]=\\frac{(n_{P}-i)\\,U_{bP}[t]+i\\,U_{HP}[t]}{U_{bP}[t]+U_{HP}[t]} \\end{equation}\\] As a consequence of this model design, types of both human and plant populations span from a non-mutualistic type (\\(i=1\\)), which has the best fitness score when there is no positive interaction with the other population (\\(U_{BA}[t]\\approx 0\\)), to a mutualistic type (\\(i=n\\)), which is the optimum when nearly the whole of the carrying capacity is due to such relationship (\\(U_{BA}[t]\\approx K_{A}[t]\\)).

We did not engage in fixing any of these parameters to fit a particular case study as a strategy to reduce the complexity of results. In turn, as our aim is to explore theoretical grounds, we scrutinised the multiverse of scenarios that potentially represent the relationship between any given human population and any given plant species. The complexity of the model was managed by exploring the parameter space progressively, observing the multiplicity of cases in single runs, two and four parameter explorations, and an extensive exploration including 15 parameters (all, except \\(ini_H\\) and \\(ini_P\\)). The latter type of exploration was performed by simulating 10.000 parameter settings sampled with the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) technique (McKay, Beckman, and Conover 1979) and Strauss optimization (Damblin, Couplet, and Iooss 2013).

For most of the conditions explored, the HPC model displays stationary points, which are attractors where variables converge and do not change unless the system is perturbed. Another kind of attractor, oscillations, exists. A special case of oscillation occurs when either the iteration unit or at least one of the intrinsic growth rates are greater than the unit ( dt &gt; 1 or rA &gt; 1 ). Such behaviour is a common feature of logistic growth models and was already observed and analysed by Hastings (1997). More interestingly, certain, less extreme parameter configurations also produce oscillatory states (see last section in this chapter).

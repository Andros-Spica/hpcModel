# Model overview { - }

The Human-Plant Coevolution (HPC) model represents the dynamics of coevolution between a human and a plant population. The model consists of an ecological positive feedback system (mutualism), which can be reinforced by positive evolutionary feedback (coevolution). The model is the result of wiring together relatively simple simulation models of population ecology and evolution, through a computational implementation in R.

**_Parameters_**

 R notation     | Math notation | Description
 -------------- | ------------- | ---------------------
 `iniH`, `iniP` | $ini_{H},\,ini_{P}$ | initial populations of humans and plants  
 `n.H`, `n.P`   | $n_{H},\,n_{P}$ | number of types of humans and plants  
 `v.H`, `v.P`   | $v_{H},\,v_{P}$ | level of undirected variation in humans and plants  
 `r.H`, `r.P`   | $r_{H},\,r_{P}$ | intrinsic growth rates for human and plant populations  
 `mU.PnH`       | $\bar{U}_{P_{n}H}$ | utility per capita **of** type n plants **to** humans  
 `mU.HnP`       | $\bar{U}_{H_{n}P}$ | utility per capita **of** type n humans **to** plants  
 `mU.P1H`       | $\bar{U}_{P_{1}H}$ | utility per capita **of** type 1 plants **to** humans  
 `mU.H1P`       | $\bar{U}_{H_{1}P}$ | utility per capita **of** type 1 humans **to** plants  
 `U.bH1`       | $U_{bH_{1}}$ | utility **of** other resources **to** humans of type 1 (the baseline carrying capacity for humans of type 1, i.e. independent of HP relationship)  
 `U.bP1`       | $U_{bP_{1}}$ | utility **of** non-anthropic space **to** type 1 plants (the baseline carrying capacity for plants of type 1, i.e. independent of HP relationship)  
 `U.bHn`       | $U_{bH_{n}}$ | utility **of** other resources **to** type n humans  
 `U.bPn`       | $U_{bP_{n}}$ | utility **of** non-anthropic space **to** type n plants  
 `MaxArea`      | $MaxArea$ | maximum contiguous area to be used by plants (i.e., maximum carrying capacity for plants)

 R notation             | Math notation | Description                                               
 ---------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------
 `time`                 | $t_{end}$ | Iterations past until the end state (*stationary point*)
 `coevo.H`, `coevo.P`   | $coevo_{H},\,coevo_{P}$ | Coevolution coefficients. A coefficient representing the distribution of the proportions of population per type ($pop_{A_1}$ to $pop_{A_n}$) weighted by type index ($1$ to $n$). Each indicates *if* and *how much* the population distribution has been modified by the coevolutionary process. Their values range between -1, the entire population is of type 1, and 1, the entire population is of type n.  
 `depend.H`, `depend.P` | $depend_{H},\,depend_{P}$ | Dependency coefficients. Slope of linear model of the fitness score per type ($fitness_{A_1}$ to $fit_{A_n}$) using type index ($1$ to $n$). Indicate *if* and *how much* the overall fitness score of a population is dependent on the other population.  
 `timing.H`, `timing.P` | $timing_{H},\,timing_{P}$ | Iterations past until coevolution successfully changes the proportions of population per type; generally, when $pop_1\gg pop_n$ or, more specifically, $coevo>timing.threshold$.

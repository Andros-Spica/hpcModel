["model-overview.html", "Model overview", " Model overview The Human-Plant Coevolution (HPC) model represents the dynamics of coevolution between a human and a plant population. The model consists of an ecological positive feedback system (mutualism), which can be reinforced by positive evolutionary feedback (coevolution). The model is the result of wiring together relatively simple simulation models of population ecology and evolution, through a computational implementation in R. Parameters Parameters R notation Math notation Description iniH, iniP \\(ini_{H},\\,ini_{P}\\) initial populations of humans and plants n.H, n.P \\(n_{H},\\,n_{P}\\) number of types of humans and plants. The number of phenotypic variants of each population that relate to human-plant coevolution. Types are arbitrarily ordered from type \\(1\\) (less mutualistic) to type \\(n\\) (more mutualistic). v.H, v.P \\(v_{H},\\,v_{P}\\) level of undirected variation in humans and plants. For any value greater than zero, these parameters regulate how even is the distribution of a population among its types. r.H, r.P \\(r_{H},\\,r_{P}\\) intrinsic growth rates for human and plant populations.

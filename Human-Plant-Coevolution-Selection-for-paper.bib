abstract = {Prehistoric cultivation of wild wheat in the Fertile Crescent led to the selection of mutants with indehiscent (nonshattering) ears, which evolved into modern domestic wheat. Previous estimates suggested that this transformation was rapid, but our analyses of archaeological plant remains demonstrate that indehiscent domesticates were slow to appear, emerging {\~{}}9500 years before the present, and that dehiscent (shattering) forms were still common in cultivated fields {\~{}}7500 years before the present. Slow domestication implies that after cultivation began, wild cereals may have remained unchanged for a long period, supporting claims that agriculture originated in the Near East {\~{}}10,500 years before the present.},

@article{Goldberg2016,
abstract = {As the last habitable continent colonized by humans, the site of multiple domestication hotspots, and the location of the largest Pleistocene megafaunal extinction, South America is central to human prehistory. Yet remarkably little is known about human population dynamics during colonization, subsequent expansions, and domestication. Here we reconstruct the spatiotemporal patterns of human population growth in South America using a newly aggregated database of 1,147 archaeological sites and 5,464 calibrated radiocarbon dates spanning fourteen thousand to two thousand years ago (ka). We demonstrate that, rather than a steady exponential expansion, the demographic history of South Americans is characterized by two distinct phases. First, humans spread rapidly throughout the continent, but remained at low population sizes for 8,000 years, including a 4,000-year period of 'boom-and-bust' oscillations with no net growth. Supplementation of hunting with domesticated crops and animals had a minimal impact on population carrying capacity. Only with widespread sedentism, beginning ∼5 ka, did a second demographic phase begin, with evidence for exponential population growth in cultural hotspots, characteristic of the Neolithic transition worldwide. The unique extent of humanity's ability to modify its environment to markedly increase carrying capacity in South America is therefore an unexpectedly recent phenomenon.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to discuss the coevolution of one of the more thor- oughly studied mutualistic systems in the New World tropics: the interdependency between the swollen-thorn acacias and their ant inhabitants. This system has recently been described in detail in respect to one species of plant, Acacia cornigera L. (Mimosoideae; Leguminosae), and one species of ant, Pseudomyrmex jerruginea F. Smith (Pseudomyrmecinae; Formici- dae), and shown experimentally to be a case of mutualism (Janzen, 1966a). In this species pair, the ant is dependent upon the acacia for food and domicile, and the acacia is dependent upon the ant for protection from phytophagous insects and neighboring plants. The literature dealing only with the New World tropical acacias (Acacia spp.) and their ants (Pseudomyrmex spp.) has been re-evalu- ated by Janzen (1966a) and will not be discussed further in a review sense.},

abstract = {The introduction of new analytic methods and expansion of research into previously untapped regions have greatly increased the scale and resolution of data relevant to the origins of agriculture (OA). As a result, the recognition of varied historical pathways to agriculture and the continuum of management strategies have complicated the search for general explanations for the transition to food production. In this environment, higher-level theoretical frameworks are sometimes rejected on the grounds that they force conclusions that are incompatible with real-world variability. Some of those who take this position argue instead that OA should be explained in terms of local and historically contingent factors. This retreat from theory in favor of particularism is based on the faulty beliefs that complex phenomena such as agricultural origins demand equally complex explanations and that explanation is possible in the absence of theoretically based assumptions. The same scholars who are suspicious of generalization are reluctant to embrace evolutionary approaches to human behavior on the grounds that they are ahistorical, overly simplistic, and dismissive of agency and intent.We argue that these criticisms are misplaced and explain why a coherent theory of human behavior that acknowledges its evolutionary history is essential to advancing understanding of OA. Continued progress depends on the integration of human behavior and culture into the emerging synthesis of evolutionary developmental biology that informs contemporary research into plant and animal domestication.},

However, direct genetic evidence for population growth after independent agricultural origins has been elusive.We estimated population sizes through time from a set of globally distributed whole mitochondrial genomes, after separating lineages associated with agricultural populations from those associated with hunter-gatherers. The coalescent-based analysis revealed strong evidence for distinct demographic expansions in Europe, southeastern Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa within the past 10,000 y. Estimates of the timing of population growth based on genetic data correspond neatly to dates for the initial origins of agriculture derived from archaeological evidence. Comparisons of rates of population growth through time reveal that the invention of agriculture facilitated a fivefold increase in population growth relative to more ancient expansions of hunter-gatherers.},

abstract = {For review March 16, 2016) Ecosystems on the verge of major reorganization-regime shift-may exhibit declining resilience, which can be detected using a collection of generic statistical tests known as early warning signals (EWSs). This study explores whether EWSs anticipated human population collapse during the European Neolithic. It analyzes recent reconstructions of European Neolithic (8-4 kya) population trends that reveal regime shifts from a period of rapid growth following the introduction of agriculture to a period of instability and collapse. We find statistical support for EWSs in advance of population collapse. Seven of nine regional datasets exhibit increasing autocorrelation and variance leading up to collapse, suggesting that these societies began to recover from perturbation more slowly as resilience declined. We derive EWS statistics from a prehistoric population proxy based on summed archaeological radiocarbon date probability densities. We use simulation to validate our methods and show that sampling biases, atmospheric effects, radiocarbon calibration error, and taphonomic processes are unlikely to explain the observed EWS patterns. The implications of these results for understanding the dynamics of Neolithic ecosystems are discussed, and we present a general framework for analyzing societal regime shifts using EWS at large spatial and temporal scales. We suggest that our findings are consistent with an adaptive cycling model that highlights both the vulnerability and resilience of early European populations.We close by discussing the implications of the detection of EWS in human systems for archaeology and sustainability science.},

abstract = {The Neolithic transition is the shift from hunting-gathering into farming. About 9000 years ago, the Neolithic transition began to spread from the Near East into Europe, until it reached Northern Europe about 5500 years ago. There are two main models of this spread. The demic model assumes that it was mainly due to the reproduction and dispersal of farmers. The cultural model assumes that European hunter-gatherers become farmers by acquiring domestic plants and animals, aswell as knowledge, from neighbouring farmers. Here we use the dates of about 900 archaeological sites to compute a speed map of the spread of the Neolithic transition in Europe. We compare the speed map to the speed ranges predicted by purely demic, demic-cultural and purely cultural models. The comparison indicates that the transition was cultural in Northern Europe, the Alpine region and west of the Black Sea. But demic diffusion was at work in other regions such as the Balkans and Central Europe. Our models can be applied to many other cultural traits. We also propose that genetic data could be gathered and used to measure the demic kernels of Early Neolithic populations. This would lead to an enormous advance in Neolithic spread modelling.},

The aim is to set the Mesolithic background against which the Early Neolithic archaeobotanical dataset is then fully reviewed. In doing so we first introduce new Mesolithic and early Neolithic data (Theopetra in Thessaly, and Revenia and Paliambela in Macedonia) and we then provide a critical overview of all other sites in Greece dated to these periods, to ultimately set new ‘seeds' for future research on the incipience of agriculture in the area.},

This allows us to study the spatial dynamics of the Neolithic transition in Iberia. We study how the Neolithic was introduced into the peninsula in order to test the hypothesis that the Neolithic was introduced almost simultaneously from two sources: one at the northeast (via the Mediterranean coast) and another one at the south (possibly from Northern Africa). We also analyze how the expansion of the Neolithic transition took place within the Iberian Peninsula and measure local rates of spread in order to identify regions with fast and slow rates (such as the slowdown at the Cantabrian coast). In addition, we attempt to reproduce the main results obtained from the GIS analysis by applying reaction–dispersal models to the expansion of the Neolithic transition in the Iberian Peninsula. We conclude that a model with two sources is a reasonable assumption that agrees better with the archaeological data available at present than a model with a single source.},

abstract = {and approved November 15, 2013 (received for review September 11, 2013) Recent increases in archaeobotanical evidence offer insights into the processes of plant domestication and agricultural origins, which evolved in parallel in several world regions. Many different crop species underwent convergent evolution and acquired domestication syndrome traits. For a growing number of seed crop species, these traits can be quantified by proxy from archaeological evidence, providing measures of the rates of change during domestication. Among domestication traits, nonshattering cereal ears evolved more quickly in general than seed size. Nevertheless, most domestication traits show similarly slow rates of phenotypic change over several centuries to millennia, and these rates were similar across different regions of origin. Crops reproduced vegetatively, including tubers and many fruit trees, are less easily documented in terms of morphological domestication, but multiple lines of evidence outline some patterns in the development of vegecultural systems across the New World and Old World tropics. Pathways to plant domestication can also be compared in terms of the cultural and economic factors occurring at the start of the process. Whereas agricultural societies have tended to converge on higher population densities and sedentism, in some instances cultivation began among sedentary hunter-gatherers whereas more often it was initiated by mobile societies of hunter-gatherers or herder-gatherers.},

abstract = {Until recently, domestication has been interpreted as a rapid process with little predomestication cultivation and a relatively rapid rise of the domestication syndrome. This interpretation has had a profound effect on the biological framework within which investigations into crop origins have been carried out. A major underlying assumption has been that artificial selection pressures were substantially stronger than natural selection pressures, resulting in genetic patterns of diversity that reflect genetic independence of geographic localities. Recent archaeobotanical evidence has overturned the notion of a rapid transition, resulting in a protracted model that undermines these assumptions. Conclusions of genome-wide multilocus studies remain problematic in their support of a rapid-transition model by indicating that domesticated crops appear to be associated by monophyly with only a single geographic locality. Simulations presented here resolve this conflict, indicating that the results observed in such studies are inevitable over time at a rate that is largely influenced by the long-term population size. Counterintuitively, multiple origin crops are shown to be more likely to produce monophyletic clades than crops of a single origin. Under the protracted transition, the importance of the rise of the domestication syndrome becomes paramount in producing the patterns of genetic diversity from which crop origins may be deduced. We identify four different interacting levels of organization that now need to be considered to track crop origins from modern genetic diversity, making crop origins a problem that could be addressed through system-based approaches.},

abstract = {Over the past several decades, archeological research on the Northwest Coast of North America has focused on the evolution of the coast's well-known native societies. This research has two broad goals: building local and regional culture histories spanning the Holocene and answering processual questions about the evolution and persistence of cultural complexity among hunter-gatherers. Cultural complexity includes relatively dense populations, partial to full sedentism, corporate groups, some degree of occupational specialization, permanent social inequality, and control of property. 1-3 Recently archeologists have begun to investigate whether the coast was a possible route for the peopling of North America. Presently, the earliest known sites on the coast date to about 9,000 BC, although it is likely that the initial occupation was earlier. Some aspects of cultural complexity had developed on the coast by 2,500 BC, with permanent inequality present by 900 BC, if not earlier. Central to this development were large corporate households, intensive food production and storage, and technological innovations including water-tight wooden containers and large-capacity boats. Patterns of complexity on the coast continued to change through the arrival of Europeans in the mid-1700s.},

Marine and aquatic resources fit uneasily into this sequence of social and economic development, and societies strongly dependent on them have often been regarded as relatively late in the sequence, geographically marginal or anomalous. We consider the biases and preconceptions of the ethnographic and archaeological records that have contributed to this view of marginality and examine some current issues focusing on the role of marine resources at the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition of northwest Europe.

abstract = {Reconstructing the evolutionary history of crop plants is fundamental for understanding their adaptation profile and the genetic basis of yield-limiting factors, which in turn are critical for future crop improvement. A major topic in this field is the recent claim for a millennia-long 'protracted' domestication process. Here we evaluate the evidence for the protracted domestication model in light of published archaeobotanical data, experimental evidence and the biology of the Near Eastern crops and their wild progenitors. The crux of our discussion is the differentiation between events or 'domestication episodes' and the later following crop evolutionary processes under domestication (frequently termed 'crop improvement stage'), which are by definition, still ongoing. We argue that by assuming a protracted millennia-long domestication process, one needlessly opts to operate within an intellectual framework that does not allow differentiating between the decisive (critical) domestication traits and their respective loci, and those that have evolved later during the crop dissemination and improvement following the episodic domestication event. Therefore, in our view, apart from the lack of experimental evidence to support it, the protracted domestication assumption undermines the resolution power of the study of both plant domestication and crop evolution, from the cultural as well as from the biological perspectives. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

In subsequent years it underwent a barrage of criticism from statisticians, economists, and biologists, a barrage directed mostly against Pearl's claim that the logistic curve was a law of growth. Nevertheless, it emerged in the mid-1930's as a central model of experimental population biology, and in its various modifications has remained an important part of modern population ecology. The history of the logistic curve reveals that its acceptance was by no means straightforward: repeated promotion of the curve by Pearl and his connections to other scientists were both important in the establishment of its place as a tool of research. The people responsible for legitimizing the logistic curve - A. J. Lotka, G. F. Gause, G. Udny Yule, and Thomas Park - all had different degrees of direct contact with Pearl in the early years of its use, and these personal contacts facilitated the acceptance of the logistic curve despite the heawy criticisms.

@article{Allaby2010,
abstract = {Abstract  Archaeobotanical evidence for Near Eastern einkorn wheat, barley, and Chinese rice suggests that the fixation of key domestication  traits such as non-shattering was slower than has often been assumed. This suggests a protracted period of pre-domestication  cultivation, and therefore implies that both in time and in space the initial start of cultivation was separated from eventual  domestication, when domesticated and wild populations would have become distinct gene pools. Archaeobotanical evidence increasingly  suggests more pathways to cultivation than are represented by modern domesticated crop lines, including apparent early experiments  with cultivation that did not lead to domestication, and early domesticates, such as two-grained einkorn and striate-emmeroid  wheats, which went extinct in prehistory. This diverse range of early crops is hard to accommodate within a single centre  of origin for all early Near Eastern cultivars, despite suggestions from genetic datasets that single origins from a single  centre ought to be expected. This apparent discrepancy between archaeobotany and genetics highlights the need for modelling  the expected genetic signature of different domestication scenarios, including multiple origins. A computer simulation of  simple plant populations with 20 chromosomes was designed to explore potential differences between single and double origins  of domesticated populations as they might appear in genomic datasets millennia later. Here we report a new simulation of a  self-pollinating (2{\%} outbreeding) plant compared to panmictic populations, and find that the general outcome is similar with  multiple starts of cultivation drifting towards apparent monophyly in genome-wide phylogenetic analysis over hundreds of generations.  This suggests that multiple origins of cultivation of a given species may be missed in some forms of modern genetic analysis,  and it highlights the need for more complex modelling of population genetic processes associated with the origins of agriculture.  },

The results show that these tools were used to process various plants, including Triticeae and Paniceae grasses, Vigna beans, Dioscorea opposita yam, and Trichosanthes kirilowii snakegourd roots. Tubers were important food resources for Paleolithic hunter-gatherers, and Paniceae grasses were exploited about 12,000 y before their domestication. The long tradition of intensive exploitation of certain types of flora helped Paleolithic people understand the properties of these plants, including their medicinal uses, and eventually led to the plants' domestication. This study sheds light on the deep history of the broad spectrumsubsistence strategy characteristic of late Pleistocene north China before the origins of agriculture in this region.},

Here we show that, in contrast to the steady population growth usually assumed, the introduction of agriculture into Europe was followed by a boom-and-bust pattern in the density of regional populations. We demonstrate that summed calibrated radiocarbon date distributions and simulation can be used to test the significance of these demographic booms and busts in the context of uncertainty in the radiocarbon date calibration curve and archaeological sampling. We report these results for Central and Northwest Europe between 8,000 and 4,000 cal. BP and investigate the relationship between these patterns and climate. However, we find no evidence to support a relationship. Our results thus suggest that the demographic patterns may have arisen from endogenous causes, although this remains speculative. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {It is well known that the Neolithic transition spread across Europe at a speed of about 1 km/yr. This result has been previously interpreted as a range expansion of the Neolithic driven mainly by demic diffusion (whereas cultural diffusion played a secondary role). However, a long-standing problem is whether this value (1 km/yr) and its interpretation (mainly demic diffusion) are characteristic only of Europe or universal (i.e. intrinsic features of Neolithic transitions all over the world). So far Neolithic spread rates outside Europe have been barely measured, and Neolithic spread rates substantially faster than 1 km/yr have not been previously reported. Here we show that the transition from hunting and gathering into herding in southern Africa spread at a rate of about 2.4 km/yr, i.e. about twice faster than the European Neolithic transition. Thus the value 1 km/yr is not a universal feature of Neolithic transitions in the world. Resorting to a recent demic-cultural wave-of-advance model, we also find that the main mechanism at work in the southern African Neolithic spread was cultural diffusion (whereas demic diffusion played a secondary role). This is in sharp contrast to the European Neolithic. Our results further suggest that Neolithic spread rates could be mainly driven by cultural diffusion in cases where the final state of this transition is herding/pastoralism (such as in southern Africa) rather than farming and stockbreeding (as in Europe).},

abstract = {For various reasons related to human diet, social prestige or cosmology, hunting - especially of large preys - has always been central in foragers' societies. When pre-Neolithic foragers have given up their nomadic way of life they have faced a sink-source problem about game procurement in the resource-catchment area around their settlements. Baiting, by mean of the cultivation of wild plants in food plots, may have help them to attract herbivores, thus improving the return of hunting activities. These foragers were also motivated by the capture of wild animals alive, in order to keep fresh meat for a while, to translocate these animals or for milk exploitation. For this capture, the use of a passive form of drive hunting seems best suited. The cultivation of food plots within the funnel and the corral might have been used to attract wild herbivores into the drive. Baiting was therefore designed either to increase the hunt or to improve the capture of large wild herbivores such as the Near-Eastern wild caprines that were later domesticated. Therefore baiting should be viewed as a hunting strategy as well as an unconscious selection mechanism since it has inadvertently contributed to the prey pathway to animal domestication. Keywords:},

abstract = {It is difficult to overstate the cultural and biological impacts that the domestication of plants and animals has had on our species. Fundamental questions regarding where, when, and how many times domestication took place have been of primary interest within a wide range of academic disciplines. Within the last two decades, the advent of new archaeological and genetic techniques has revolutionized our understanding of the pattern and process of domestication and agricultural origins that led to our modern way of life. In the spring of 2011, 25 scholars with a central interest in domestication representing the fields of genetics, archaeobotany, zooarchaeology, geoarchaeology, and archaeology met at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center to discuss recent domestication research progress and identify challenges for the future. In this introduction to the resulting Special Feature, we present the state of the art in the field by discussing what is known about the spatial and temporal patterns of domestication, and controversies surrounding the speed, intentionality, and evolutionary aspects of the domestication process. We then highlight three key challenges for future research. We conclude by arguing that although recent progress has been impressive, the next decade will yield even more substantial insights not only into how domestication took place, but also when and where it did, and where and why it did not.},

abstract = {Domestication is a co-evolutionary process that occurs when wild plants are brought into cultivation by humans, leading to origin of new species and/or differentiated populations that are critical for human survival. Darwin used domesticated species as early models for evolution, highlighting their variation and the key role of selection in species differentiation. Over the last two decades, a growing synthesis of plant genetics, genomics, and archaeobotany has led to challenges to old orthodoxies and the advent of fresh perspectives on how crop domestication and diversification proceed. I discuss four new insights into plant domestication — that in general domestication is a protracted process, that unconscious (natural) selection plays a prominent role, that interspecific hybridization may be an important mechanism for crop species diversification and range expansion, and that similar genes across multiple species underlies parallel/convergent phenotypic evolution between domesticated taxa. Insights into the evolutionary origin and diversification of crop species can help us in developing new varieties (and possibly even new species) to deal with current and future environmental challenges in a sustainable manner. Purugganan reviews the insights into crop domestication that have been reinforced by recent research in genetics/genomics and archaeobotany.},

abstract = {The Origins of Agriculture: New Data, New Ideas resulted from a Wenner-Gren-sponsored symposium held at the Hacienda Temozon, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico, March 6–13, 2009 (fig. 1). The symposium was organized by T. Douglas Price (Uni- versity of Wisconsin–Madison and the University of Aber- deen) and Ofer Bar-Yosef (Harvard University). The major aim of the symposium was to better understand the origins of agriculture in light of new fieldwork, new sites, new analytical techniques, and more radiocarbon dates. The global nature of agricultural origins was a key theme, and a major focus of the discussions was on East Asia as well as lesser-known regions such as Papua New Guinea, Africa, and eastern North America, alongside more traditional areas such as the Near East and Mesoamerica. The papers presented in this supplementary issue are designed to provide the latest information on the antiquity of agriculture covering at least 10 different centers of domestication. The organizers, Price and Bar-Yosef, note in their intro- duction that emerging data point to an unexpected synchron- icity in the timing of the first domesticates around the end of the Pleistocene. They also note that, contrary to earlier thought, the environments in which agriculture originated were not marginal and that agricultural experimentation took place in areas of concentrations of populations and resources. Each major area may also have included multiple loci for domestication. These were major areas of agreement in a meeting that was characterized by lively debate over the va- riety of hypotheses proposed for agricultural origins and whether global or more area-specific explanations were most appropriate. As in any good meeting, there were more ques- tions than answers, but this is the sign of a dynamic field. The degree of collegiality and collaboration among the diverse symposium participants and the speed at which new data are accumulating are good signs that our understanding of this important period in human adaptation will continue to evolve rapidly. TheWenner-Gren Foundation has had a long-standing in- Leslie C. Aiello is President of the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research (470 Park Avenue South, 8th Floor North, New York, New York 10016, U.S.A.). terest in the origins of agriculture and domestication. One of the earliest meetings organized by the Foundation in July 1960 led to the seminal publication Courses toward Urban Life: Archaeological Considerations of Some Cultural Alternates (Braidwood and Willey 1962). Other influential meetings in- cluded the Origins of African Plant Domestication (Harlan, De Wet, and Stemler 1972) and Where the Wild Things Are Now (Mullin and Cassidy 2007), which invited anthropologists from all subfields to rethink the concept of domestication in anthropology. Information on these meetings and others can be found on our Web site at http://wennergren.org/history. Most recently, agricultural origins were explored in a special issue of Current Anthropology titled Rethinking the Origins of Agriculture introduced by Mark Cohen (Cohen 2009). The current supplementary issue continues the discussions and debates explored in this earlier contribution but is perhaps more data rich and geographically diverse. Together these two CA issues provide an excellent contemporary overview of the state of research in this exciting area of inquiry. The Wenner-Gren Foundation is always looking for in- novative new directions in the field for future Foundation- sponsored and organized symposia and eventual CA publi- cation.We encourage anthropologists to contact us with their ideas for future meetings.

abstract = {The introduction of new analytic methods and expansion of research into previously untapped regions have greatly increased the scale and resolution of data relevant to the origins of agriculture (OA). As a result, the recognition of varied historical pathways to agriculture and the continuum of management strategies have complicated the search for general explanations for the transition to food production. In this environment, higher-level theoretical frameworks are sometimes rejected on the grounds that they force conclusions that are incompatible with real-world variability. Some of those who take this position argue instead that OA should be explained in terms of local and historically contingent factors. This retreat from theory in favor of particularism is based on the faulty beliefs that complex phenomena such as agricultural origins demand equally complex explanations and that explanation is possible in the absence of theoretically based assumptions. The same scholars who are suspicious of generalization are reluctant to embrace evolutionary approaches to human behavior on the grounds that they are ahistorical, overly simplistic, and dismissive of agency and intent. We argue that these criticisms are misplaced and explain why a coherent theory of human behavior that acknowledges its evolutionary history is essential to advancing understanding of OA. Continued progress depends on the integration of human behavior and culture into the emerging synthesis of evolutionary developmental biology that informs contemporary research into plant and animal domestication.},

abstract = {All Paleolithic hominids lived by hunting and collecting wild foods, an aspect of existence that began to disappear only with the emergence of the farming and herding societies of the Neolithic ≤10,000 years ago (10 KYA). What are the roots of this remarkable economic transformation? The answer lies in equally revolutionary changes that took place within certain stone age cultures several millennia before. In 1968, Lewis R. Binford noted what appeared to be substantial diversification of human diets in middle- and high-latitude Europe at the end of the Paleolithic, roughly 12–8 KYA (1). Rapid diversification in hunting, food processing, and food storage equipment generally accompanied dietary shifts, symptoms of intensified use of habitats, and fuller exploitation of the potential foodstuffs they contained. Some of this behavior was directed to grinding, drying, and storing nuts, but it also involved small animals (2–6). Kent Flannery pushed these observations further in 1969 with his “Broad Spectrum Revolution” (BSR) hypothesis, proposing that the emergence of the Neolithic in western Asia was prefaced by increases in dietary breadth in foraging societies just before this period (7). He argued that subsistence diversification, mainly by adding new species to the diet, raised the carrying capacity of an environment increasingly constrained by climate instability at the end of the Pleistocene. Binford's and Flannery's papers have stimulated much archaeological research over three decades. Inspired by the early works of Odum and Odum (8), Emlen (9), and MacArthur and Pianka (10), both archaeologists argued that economic change resulted from unprecedented demographic crowding in certain regions of the world. Some archaeologists have questioned the role of “population pressure” in human social evolution (6, 11), but most continue to think of demographic factors as one of several ingredients necessary to the forager-to-farmer transition or the Paleolithic to the Neolithic {\ldots}},

abstract = {More than 40. years ago Kent Flannery coined the term. Broad Spectrum Revolution (BSR) in reference to a broadening of the subsistence base of Late Pleistocene hunter-gatherers in the Near East that preceded and helped pave the way for the domestication and plants and animals and the emergence of agriculture. Set within a demographic density model that projected differential rates of population growth and emigration in different resource zones of the Near East, Flannery's BSR quickly became a global construct linking resource diversification and intensification to imbalances between population and environmental carrying capacity. In recent years the BSR has proven especially attractive to researchers working within an optimal foraging theory (OFT) framework in which diversification and intensification of subsistence only occurs within the context of resource depression, caused by either demographic pressure or environmental deterioration. This OFT perspective, that situates human societies in a one-way adaptive framework as they are forced to adapt to declining availability of optimal resources, however, is increasingly being called into question. Numerous examples of diversification and intensification are being documented in contexts of resource abundance shaped, in part, by deliberate human efforts at ecosystem engineering intended to promote resource productivity. An alternative approach, framed within a newer paradigm from evolutionary biology, niche construction theory (NCT), provides a more powerful explanatory framework for the BSR wherever it occurred. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Several independent trajectories of subsistence intensification, often leading to agriculture, began during the Holocene. No plant-rich intensifications are known from the Pleistocene, even from the late Pleistocene when human populations were otherwise quite sophisticated. Recent data from ice and ocean-core climate proxies show that last glacial climates were extremely hostile to agriculture—dry, low in atmospheric CO 2 , and extremely variable on quite short time scales. We hypothesize that agriculture was impossible under last-glacial conditions. The quite abrupt final amelioration of the climate was followed immediately by the beginnings of plant-intensive resource-use strategies in some areas, although the turn to plants was much later elsewhere. Almost all trajectories of subsistence intensification in the Holocene are progressive, and eventually agriculture became the dominant strategy in all but marginal environments. We hypothesize that, in the Holocene, agriculture was, in the long run, compulsory. We use a mathematical analysis to argue that the rate-limiting process for intensification trajectories must generally be the rate of innovation of subsistence technology or subsistence-related social organization. At the observed rates of innovation, population growth will always be rapid enough to sustain a high level of population pressure. Several processes appear to retard rates of cultural evolution below the maxima we observe in the most favorable cases.},

Our symposium brought together a diverse international group of archaeological scientists to consider a topic of common interest and substantial anthropological import-the origins of agriculture. The group included individuals working in most of the places where farming began. This issue is organized by chronology and geography. Our goal was to consider the most recent data and ideas from these different regions in order to examine larger questions of congruity and disparity among the groups of first farmers. There is much new information from a number of important areas, particularly Asia. Following a review of the history of investigation of agricultural origins, this introduction summarizes the results of the conference. There are at least 10 different places around the world where agriculture was independently developed, and the antiquity of domestication is being pushed back in time with new discoveries. Our symposium has emphasized the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to such large questions in order to assemble as much information as possible. We anticipate that the results and consequences of this symposium will have long-term ripple effects in anthropology and archaeology. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.},

abstract = {The colonization of the human environment by plants, and the consequent evolution of domesticated forms is increasingly being viewed as a co-evolutionary plant-human process that occurred over a long time period, with evidence for the co-evolutionary relationship between plants and humans reaching ever deeper into the hominin past. This developing view is characterized by a change in emphasis on the drivers of evolution in the case of plants. Rather than individual species being passive recipients of artificial selection pressures and ultimately becoming domesticates, entire plant communities adapted to the human environment. This evolutionary scenario leads to systems level genetic expectations from models that can be explored through ancient DNA and Next Generation Sequencing approaches. Emerging evidence suggests that domesticated genomes fit well with these expectations, with periods of stable complex evolution characterized by large amounts of change associated with relatively small selective value, punctuated by periods in which changes in one-half of the plant-hominin relationship cause rapid, low-complexity adaptation in the other. A corollary of a single plant-hominin co-evolutionary process is that clues about the initiation of the domestication process may well lie deep within the hominin lineage.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to review the current evidence for plant use in Mesolithic Europe and to summarize its implications. In order to do so, four sources of data are examined: macrobotanical remains, palynological data, artefactual evidence, and the human biological record. A prelimary survey of palaeobotanical evidence for plant use in the Mesolithic indicates that the evidence is far more extensive than expected hitherto and that accumulations of plant food, especially of nuts, point to their regular and extensive use. In those areas such as Britain, where a large number of fine-resolution palynological studies have been carried out, the incidence of clearance and burning phases seems to be too high to be explained by acts of nature alone. A good case can be made for deliberate forest clearance and the maintenance of a more open landscape by Late Mesolithic groups as part of a promotional strategy to increase the productivity of nut and fruit trees and shrubs. wetland Plants, and Possibly native grasses. Artefactual evidence points to a widespread distribution of soil-working tools (hoes and antler mattocks), especially in temperate Europe, and to a greater than expected presence of reaping and grinding equipment, lending conditional support for the existence of a specialized plant processing tool kit for digging, reaping, and plant processing. Palaeopathological evidence indicates the existence of a dietary pattern in the west Mediterranean making extensive use of starchy and carbohydrate foods which resulted in a high caries rate among the Mesolithic population of that area. In discussing the significanse of these four lines of evidence, it is argued that, by the Late Mesolithic, the patterns of plant use support the notion of wild plant food husbandry instead of the incidental and opportunistic use of plants for food which has implicitly been accepted as a norm for the Mesolithic in Europe. Three geographical areas can be identified with their specific pattern of plant use: temperate Europe, Mediterranean Europe, and the south-eastern Balkans/Pontic Steppe. The patterns of plant use suggested in this paper emphasize the additive nature of the adoption of the agro-pastoral Neolithic farming practices in Europe. {\textcopyright} 1994, The Prehistoric Society.

abstract = {The scale and nature of early cultivation are topics that have received relatively limited attention in research on the origins of agriculture. In Southwest Asia, one the earliest centers of origin worldwide, the transition to food production is commonly portrayed as a macroevolutionary process from hunter-gatherer through to cultivator-forager and farming stages. Climate change, resource intensification, sedentism, rising population densities, and increasing social complexity are widely considered by prehistorians as pivotal to the emergence of protoagricultural village life. In this paper we revisit these narratives that have been influenced by culture-history and social evolution, together forming the dominant theoretical paradigms in the prehistory of Southwest Asia. We propose a complementary contextual approach seeking to reconstruct the historical development of Early Holocene plant-food production and its manifold sociocultural environments by intersecting multiple lines of evidence on the biology of plant domestication, resource management strategies, settlement patterns, cultivation and harvesting technologies, food storage, processing and consumption, ritual practices and symbolic behaviors. Furthermore, we propose that early plant-food production in Southwest Asia should be dissociated from ethnographically derived notions of sedentary village life. Plants emerge as important components of community interactions and ritual performances involving suprahousehold groups that were mediated through communal food consumption.},

Surprisingly, existing systems for representing these global patterns, including biome classifications, either ignore humans altogether or simplify human influence into, at most, four categories.

Eighteen "anthropogenic biomes" were identified through empirical analysis of global population, land use, and land cover. More than 75{\%} of Earth's ice-free land showed evidence of alteration as a result of human residence and land use, with less than a quarter remaining as wildlands, supporting just 11{\%} of terrestrial net primary production.

Three central aspects of domestication that cut across and unify this diverse array of research perspectives are addressed here. Domestication is defined as a distinctive coevolutionary, mutualistic relationship between domesticator and domesticate and distinguished from related but ultimately different processes of resource management and agriculture. The relative utility of genetic, phenotypic, plastic, and contextual markers of evolving domesticatory relationships is discussed. Causal factors are considered, and two leading explanatory frameworks for initial domestication of plants and animals, one grounded in optimal foraging theory and the other in niche-construction theory, are compared.},

The notion of replicator-or, more precisely, of "active germ-line rep-licator"-has been persuasively put forward by Dawkins (1982) as a basic entity of the theory of natural selection. We want to stress the usefulness of this term by supplementing Dawkins' arguments from a biomathematical viewpoint. Indeed, four well-established models in quite distinct evolutionary contexts-genetics, ecology, prebiotic chemistry and sociobiology-lead to the same class of differential equations. It may therefore be natural, for certain purposes, to abstract from the specific biological setup and view the dynamics as description of the-evolution of replicators.

Research conducted at the Balma Abeurador and a complex of related Epipalaeolithic and Mesolithic sites in the western Languedoc and eastern Pyrenees region of France (Abri de Dourgne, Grotte Gazel, Balma Margineda) reveals the complex processes of cultural and economic development during the early Holocene at a time of significant environmental change. Mesolithic groups expanded their subsistence base into a veritable “broad spectrum” economy including the hunting of large mammals, small game and birds; seasonal fishing for salmonids; collecting terrestrial and marine molluscs; and the gathering of wild legumes, fruits and nuts. The identification at Abeurador of lentils, peas and chick peas morphologically indistinguishable from the early cultigens of Southwest Asia raises the question of incipient cultivation practices in the west Mediterranean as early as 10,000 b.p.

abstract = {The ability of many insects to exploit potential food resources to the best advantage, or even to utilize them at all, is dependent upon a reciprocally beneficial association with specific microorganisms referred to as symbiotes or symbionts. This is true of many species of insects existing in such an as­ sociation with fungoid organisms and deriving their nourishment directly or indirectly from trees. It is an instance of that special form of symbiosis known as mutualism, in which mutual advantages accrue from a close asso­ ciation between individuals of different species. Mutualism thus excludes associations in which two species merely coexist, compete, or provide benefits to only one. It does not prescribe obligatory dependency of one partner on the other, though such dependency is not uncommon. The scope of the present topic encompasses not only associations in which the fungus becomes the food source or modifies the tree as a food medium for the insect, but also those in which the fungus does not act directly on the tree but enables the insect to exist as a viable organism capable of exploiting the tree. In order to delimit the scope of the topic under review, it is necessary to recognize the term "fungus" in its broad botanical sense. The subject thus includes not only the nonchlorophyllous plants possessing the filamentous structure known as a mycelium, but also the nonfilamentous forms known as yeasts. The phenomenon of pleomorphism in which certain fungi display both filamentous and yeastlike forms shows that a sharp line of distinction does not exist. In addition, it is necessary to include here reference to certain microorganisms whose morphological characteristics appear to place their systematic position in such doubt that they are regarded as yeasts by certain authorities (11) and as bacteria by others (65). The kinds of symbiotes ex­ cluded from this review are the known bacteria and the protozoa. The in­ clusion of the yeasts with filamentous fungi embraces a consideration of both endosymbiosis and ectosymbiosis. The former term pertains to symbiosis in which the microorganisms contribute to the insect while living within it, often in an intracellular situation. Ectosymbiosis here pertains to symbiosis in which the microorganism carries on its active functions while dissociated from its insect vector; the benefits accrue indirectly to the insect by the 1 The survey of the literature pertaining to this review was concluded in April 1966.},

abstract = {Using cemetery data, it has been possible to identify the signature of a previously unknown demographic process associated with the transition from a hunter-gatherer to an agricultural economy. Characterized by a dramatic increase in the birth rate, and consequently of the population growth rate, over a period of less than a millennium following the transition to agriculture, this global demographic process has been termed the Neolithic Demographic Transition (NDT). The NDT signature has so far been detected in Europe, North America, Mesoamerica and South America. The methodological innovation which has made possible the identification of the NDT is the use of a relative chronology, fixed to the local onset of the Neolithic. That is, events are considered not in terms of their absolute calendar dates, but rather in terms of their relation to the local date of the transition to agriculture. This volume presents and discusses the consequences and implications of the NDT on a global scale. Topics include: The auses of the NDT at its onset; Indicators of economic intensification as related to the NDT; Settlement and village practices associated with the pace of the NDT; The emergence of social practices associated with larger population concentrations; The effects of increased population density on human health. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {The Natufian culture (c. 14.6–11.5 ka cal. BP) represents the last hunter-gatherer society that inhabited southwest Asia before the development of plant food production. It has long been suggested that Natufians based their economy on the exploitation of the wild ancestors of the Neolithic “founder crops”, and that these hunter-gatherers were therefore on the “threshold to agriculture”. In this work we review the available data on Natufian plant exploitation and we report new archaeobotanical evidence from Shubayqa 1, a Natufian site located in northeastern Jordan (14.6–11.5 ka cal. BP). Shubayqa 1 has produced an exceptionally large plant assemblage, including direct evidence for the continuous exploitation of club-rush tubers (often regarded as “missing foods”) and other wild plants, which were probably used as food, fuel and building materials. Taking together this data we evaluate the composition of archaeobotanical assemblages (plant macroremains) from the Natufian to the Early Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (EPPNB). Natufian assemblages comprise large proportions of non-founder plant species ({\textgreater}90{\%} on average), amongst which sedges, small-seeded grasses and legumes, and fruits and nuts predominate. During the Pre-Pottery Neolithic, in particular the EPPNB, the presence of “founder crops” increases dramatically and constitute up to c. 42{\%} of the archaeobotanical assemblages on average. Our results suggest that plant exploitation strategies during the Natufian were very different from those attested during subsequent Neolithic periods. We argue that historically driven interpretations of the archaeological record have over-emphasized the role of the wild ancestors of domesticated crops previous to the emergence of agriculture.},

abstract = {Farming and herding were introduced to Europe from the Near East and Anatolia; there are, however, considerable arguments about the mechanisms of this transition. Were it the people who moved and either outplaced or admixed with the indigenous hunter-gatherer groups? Or was it material and information that moved—the Neolithic Package—consisting of domesticated plants and animals and the knowledge of their use? The latter process is commonly referred to as cultural diffusion and the former as demic diffusion. Despite continuous and partly combined efforts by archaeologists, anthropologists, linguists, palaeontologists and geneticists, a final resolution of the debate has not yet been reached. In the present contribution we interpret results from the Global Land Use and technological Evolution Simulator (GLUES). This mathematical model simulates regional sociocultural development embedded in the geoenvironmental context during the Holocene. We demonstrate that the model is able to realistically hindcast the expansion speed and the inhomogeneous space-time evolution of the transition to agropastoralism in western Eurasia. In contrast to models that do not resolve endogenous sociocultural dynamics, our model describes and explains how and why the Neolithic advanced in stages. We uncouple the mechanisms of migration and information exchange and also of migration and the spread of agropastoralism. We find that (1) an indigenous form of agropastoralism could well have arisen in certain Mediterranean landscapes but not in northern and central Europe, where it depended on imported technology and material; (2) both demic diffusion by migration and cultural diffusion by trade may explain the western European transition equally well; (3) migrating farmers apparently contribute less than local adopters to the establishment of agropastoralism. Our study thus underlines the importance of adoption of introduced technologies and economies by resident foragers.},

abstract = {Domestic animals have played a key role in human history. Despite their importance, however, the origins of most domestic species remain poorly understood. We assessed the phylogenetic history and population structure of domestic goats by sequencing a hypervariable segment (481 bp) of the mtDNA control region from 406 goats representing 88 breeds distributed across the Old World. Phylogeographic analysis revealed three highly divergent goat lineages (estimated divergence {\textgreater}200,000 years ago), with one lineage occurring only in eastern and southern Asia. A remarkably similar pattern exists in cattle, sheep, and pigs. These results, combined with recent archaeological findings, suggest that goats and other farm animals have multiple maternal origins with a possible center of origin in Asia, as well as in the Fertile Crescent. The pattern of goat mtDNA diversity suggests that all three lineages have undergone population expansions, but that the expansion was relatively recent for two of the lineages (including the Asian lineage). Goat populations are surprisingly less genetically structured than cattle populations. In goats only approximately 10{\%} of the mtDNA variation is partitioned among continents. In cattle the amount is {\textgreater}/=50{\%}. This weak structuring suggests extensive intercontinental transportation of goats and has intriguing implications about the importance of goats in historical human migrations and commerce.},

abstract = {This paper presents a Levantine model for the origins of cultivation of various wild plants as motivated by the vagaries of the climatic fluctuation of the Younger Dryas within the context of the mosaic ecology of the region that affected communities that were already sedentary or semisedentary. In addition to holding to their territories, these communities found ways to intensify their food procurement strategy by adopting intentional growth of previously known annuals, such as a variety of cereals. The Levantine sequence, where Terminal Pleistocene and Early Holocene Neolithic archaeology is well known, is employed as a model for speculating on the origins of millet cultivation in northern China, where both the archaeological data and the dates are yet insufficient to document the evolution of socioeconomic changes that resulted in the establishment of an agricultural system. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.},

@article{Damblin2013,
abstract = {Quantitative assessment of the uncertainties tainting the results of computer simulations is nowadays a major topic of interest in both industrial and scientific communities. One of the key issues in such studies is to get information about the output when the numerical simulations are expensive to run. This paper considers the problem of exploring the whole space of variations of the computer model input variables in the context of a large dimensional exploration space. Various properties of space filling designs are justified: interpoint-distance, discrepancy, minimum spanning tree criteria. A specific class of design, the optimized Latin Hypercube Sample, is considered. Several optimization algorithms, coming from the literature, are studied in terms of convergence speed, robustness to subprojection and space filling properties of the resulting design. Some recommendations for building such designs are given. Finally, another contribution of this paper is the deep analysis of the space filling properties of the design 2D-subprojections.},

@article{Morgan2015,
abstract = {Originally designed to explain causes of increased productivity in agricultural systems, the concept of intensification has become widely linked to hunter-gatherer archaeology. Worldwide, recent applications show that progress has been made with regard to recognizing, describing, and modeling the declining foraging efficiency predicted by traditional intensification models that take into account confounding factors like taphonomy, environmental change, and differential foraging goals. Less progress has been made in explaining intensification due to problems of identifying primacy in the environmental, demographic, technological, and social mechanisms that lead to increased production. These problems are confounded by imprecise usage of the concept “intensification,” which runs the gamut from behaviors that either increase or decrease efficiency as the means of increasing productivity. Resolving these problems hinges on unpacking the very concept of intensification as currently applied to hunter-gatherer archaeology. This requires much greater specificity with regard to efficiency and adherence to a Boserupian perspective that declining efficiency marks intensification processes. Alternative modes of increasing production that do not necessarily entail declining efficiency—specialization, diversification, and innovation—also must be taken into account to explain the evolution of hunter-gatherer economies.},
